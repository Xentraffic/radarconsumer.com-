      <p class="eplus-nuQVOw">If you’re one of the 1 billion people who suffer from a lung condition like asthma or
        COPD, then you’re going to love hearing about this recent breakthrough: <strong>A new device that cleans
          your lungs of mucus – along with strengthening them </strong><strong><em>without </em></strong><strong>the
          need for drugs – is now available worldwide.</strong></p>
      <p class="eplus-WR2rKf">Seeing as <strong>lung obstruction is the 3rd leading cause of death in the
          US,</strong> those who use the device are breathing a sigh of relief (no pun intended).</p>
      <p class="eplus-Vje97i">The device helps tackle a serious problem for those with lung conditions that most
        current medications don’t address: <strong>mucus buildup.</strong></p>
      <p class="eplus-4hmqy2"><strong>If mucus builds up in your lungs, it can cause serious complications like
          reduced airflow and shortness of breath<strong>…</strong> which can even lead to death.</strong></p>
      <p class="eplus-mUvvZt">This new device provides an <strong>all-natural method</strong> for those with lung
        conditions to<strong> quickly and easily reduce mucus buildup. </strong>Even better, you can feel it
        working<strong> in a matter of seconds </strong>and it’s small enough to carry with you anywhere you go.</p>
      <p class="eplus-xdxq4z">Not only that but the science behind AirPhysio is proven to be <strong>incredibly
          effective for smokers, athletes and others who wish to clean and strengthen their lungs.</strong></p>
      <p class="eplus-0mobrq">Finally, it’s also being used by those with respiratory conditions (such as a cold,
        pneumonia or even flu-like viruses) to <strong>get instant relief from the most frustrating symptoms:
          wheezing, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath.</strong></p>
      <p class="eplus-5w2Ckh">The device is called <strong>AirPhysio</strong>, and after years of testing and
        finding success in Australia (including two prestigious awards and thousands of positive reviews), the
        device is <strong>finally available worldwide.</strong></p>
      <p class="eplus-zriS8x">Whether you suffer from a lung condition OR you simply want to ensure your lungs are
        strong and healthy, then keep reading – because you’re going to love what the folks at AirPhysio have
        created.</p>
      <h2 class="eplus-Zdix7y">What is AirPhysio?</h2>
      <figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized eplus-nJHfYy"><a
          href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"><img src="one.jpg" class="wp-image-321" style="width: 100%;"></a>
      </figure>
      <p class="eplus-LU3Ojb">AirPhysio is a <strong>mucus clearance and lung expansion device</strong> that
        <strong>cleans your lungs and increases lung capacity</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="eplus-niCgAb">The specially designed device uses a revolutionary method to <strong>naturally loosen
          the phlegm in your chest – helping you breathe easier in just a few days.</strong></p>
      <p class="eplus-mM1JWG">Even better, <strong>AirPhysio is completely drug-free<strong>…</strong> it doesn’t
          require a prescription<strong>…</strong> </strong>and it’s <strong>completely safe for anyone to use.
        </strong>That’s right – there are no chemicals or toxins involved, which means <strong>no worrying about
          nasty side effects </strong>(like dizziness, headache, rash, and nausea) or potential problems that come
        from long-term drug use.</p>
      <figure class="wp-block-image size-large eplus-zYWELk" id="is-isnot"><a
          href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"><img src="airphysio-adv-01-03.jpg" style="width: 100%;"
            class="wp-image-944"></a></figure>
      <p class="eplus-poEmXh">In fact, AirPhysio uses technology that <strong>doctors have been using in hospitals
          for years…</strong> it just hasn’t been available to the public. But now, thanks to a team of Australian
        innovators, it’s here – and now you have an easy, safe way to clean your lungs whenever you feel the need.
      </p>
      <p class="eplus-K0QOKK">Reports are already flowing in about its powerful potential. After just a few days,
        many asthmatics report that they <strong>don’t need to use their inhaler as often<strong>…</strong>
        </strong>but most importantly, it <strong>strengthens and cleans your lungs <em>naturally</em></strong> –
        which everyone can certainly benefit from.</p>
      <h2 class="eplus-LpkK7J">How does AirPhysio work?</h2>
      <p class="eplus-AZeIO3">Using AirPhysio is easy – it’s like an OPEP device, but much more efficient:</p>
      <ol class="eplus-PJjy9g">
        <li><strong>Blow into the AirPhysio.</strong> You don’t need to breathe too hard – just enough to make the
          ball bearing inside the clear cap lift up (that’s how you know it’s working). This <strong>builds pressure
            within the lungs</strong>, which <strong>opens them up and gets behind the mucus </strong>that’s
          responsible for the heaviness in your chest.</li>
        <li>As the mucus is lifted upward toward the throat, you’ll be able to <strong>remove it by
            coughing.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Repeat this process as often as needed </strong>(usually about 10 times) to fully clean your
          lungs from the mucus. The more you use it, the cleaner your lungs will be!</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="eplus-njcge9">Users say <strong>the feeling of relief is truly <em>fantastic. </em></strong>And even
        better, you’re actually <strong>building strength in your lungs</strong> with each use. (Think about
        it<strong>…</strong> you can exercise pretty much every other muscle in your body. Why not show your lungs
        some love?)</p>
      <h2 class="eplus-60qXDz">Who can use AirPhysio?</h2>
      <figure class="wp-block-image size-large eplus-iZbzzz"><a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"><img
            style="width: 100%;" src="BreatheBetter-edited.jpg" class="wp-image-438"></a>
      </figure>
      <p class="eplus-PLq9fS">Naturally, it’s become an instant hit among those with chronic lung conditions – but
        that’s not all.</p>
      <p class="eplus-t3wJFx">AirPhysio is also <strong>incredibly effective in cleaning your lungs when you have a
          temporary condition like the cold, the flu, or pneumonia</strong> – because it <em>instantly </em>reduces
        that “chest heaviness” caused by mucus buildup.</p>
      <p class="eplus-KtjOl9">It’s also become popular among athletes, who use it to <strong>reduce breathlessness
          during exercise and speed up recovery times after working out or training.</strong></p>
      <p class="eplus-DeFdKy">Even <strong>children </strong>aged 4 and up can use it to relieve symptoms and
        strengthen their lungs!</p>
      <p class="eplus-DeYQtf">Those who will benefit most from the stronger lungs AirPhysio gives you include:</p>
      <ul class="eplus-rFxWQM">
        <li><strong>People with Asthma, COPD, Emphysema, Atelectasis, Bronchiectasis, Chronic Bronchitis or Cystic
            Fibrosis</strong></li>
        <li>The Elderly</li>
        <li><strong>Smokers &amp; Vapers</strong></li>
        <li>Swimmers, Divers, and other Athletes</li>
        <li><strong>Singers &amp; Musicians</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <figure class="wp-block-image size-large eplus-Jls5RP" id="breathing-issues"><a
          href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"><img src="airphysio-g8-02.jpg" class="wp-image-564"
            style="width: 100%;"></a></figure>
      <h2 class="eplus-bSdo97">Bottom line: AirPhysio is a breakthrough in lung care – and it’s finally available
        worldwide.</h2>
      <p class="eplus-vfRaFe">Not only does AirPhysio work REALLY well, it’s also <strong>easy to
          use<strong>…</strong> easy to clean</strong> (just use hot water) and it <strong>lasts for decades.
        </strong>To top it off, there are <strong>no batteries, refills or drugs to keep buying, and it includes a
          lifetime warranty </strong>– in other words, it’s a one-time purchase.</p>
      <p class="eplus-egaiOY">Users are happy, and so are doctors<strong><strong>…</strong></strong> in fact, it’s
        already earned <strong>thousands of 5-star reviews </strong>since being launched globally. It’s also
        <strong>won multiple awards,</strong> including Start-Up Of The Year and the International Best Product
        Award.
      </p>
      <p class="eplus-mfotyB">Whether you’re a smoker, suffer from chronic lung conditions, or want to prepare your
        lungs for a future illness that may reduce your lung strength, one thing is clear: AirPhysio’s unique
        solution may change your life. We highly recommend it!</p>
