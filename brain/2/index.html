        <p class="lead">We expose the truth behind a ground-breaking pill that
          has many experts furious. Studies have revealed it boosts brain power by
          up to 89.2%, sharpens your mind and sky-rockets your energy levels.
          With such overwhelming evidence and media mention, the question is not
          whether the pill works, but whether it should be legal.</p>
        <p><strong>Welcome To The Future</strong> - The use of a Legal Study
          Drug known as <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a> has
          skyrocketed on college campuses across the US
          since coming back on the market in September. It’s being touted as an
          Adderall replacement, and many students are taking full advantage of its
          availability to buy online without a prescription.</p>

        <p>There has been much controversy around this memory-enhancing pill,
          not only on college campuses, but also in the media. It first came into
          the spotlight when the movie Limitless became a box office hit and
          several blogs started comparing it to Adderall. Sales tripled
          overnight as students, athletes, entrepreneurs, and business executives
          all wanted to get their hands on this powerful brain enhancer.</p>
        <p><a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a>, which has no recorded
          side effects in any clinical trials,
          was soon the target of critics who claimed it was too powerful to be
          sold without a prescription. Other people in academic circles insisted
          that it provided an artificial edge for its users and was unfair to
          those who weren’t taking it. This led to it being banned from quiz
          shows and at many top universities as well. Facing outside pressure, the
          creators of <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a> were
          eventually forced to halt production of the
          <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Limitless Pills</a>.
        </p>
        <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">
          <img src="articlessmart.png"></a>
        <p>Fortunately, after 3 years of litigation and clinical studies showing
          its safety, the online ban was finally lifted and the creators of <a
            href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X
            Focus</a>
          were allowed to resume selling on their website.
          Its reappearance has thrilled users around the world — people who
          genuinely suffered during its absence. “My ability to think and focus
          more than doubled when I was able to buy again. The pill’s
          return prevented me from dropping out of college,” a premed student told
          us.

        <h3><strong>We tested it ourselves — is it all hype?</strong></h3>
        <p>With so much praise from the media and countless reviews
          from people experiencing success with <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank"></a>,
          we at Health Science Today wanted to verify whether this was all hype.
          Practically everyone in our building volunteered to test it out, but we
          chose our Health &amp; Science Editor, Alan Frasier. Below is his
          account of using <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a> over a 4
          week period.</p>

        <h3>My Results — 4 Weeks on <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a>
        </h3>
        <h3>Week One</h3>
        <div class="week">
          <p>Buying a bottle of <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a>
            proved to be tougher than I ever imagined.
            It was SOLD OUT on their website almost immediately after coming back
            on the market. Some Ebay sellers were asking $300 for just 1 Bottle!
            That’s too rich for me. I finally secured a few bottles at their regular
            price after waiting 2 long weeks for <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X
              Focus</a> to restock.</p>
          <p>About 30 minutes after taking my first pill, I felt the effects kick
            in. It started with a pleasant wave of calmness that washed over my
            entire body like a warm blanket. The mental fog and stress I’d been
            carrying around vanished instantly. Soon, I reached a level of alertness
            and concentration I’d never experienced before. Sounds didn’t even
            register. It was like walking around on a winter day after it just
            snowed. It became easy for me to ignore distractions and outside noises.
            Best of all, there weren’t any of the negative side effects like I get
            when taking Adderall.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Week Two</h3>
        <div class="week">
          <p>I was a bit concerned that <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X
              Focus</a> would stop working for me after
            one week. Not so. I am feeling even more focused and energized than
            before. After a 10-hour work day my energy levels were still high, and I
            was focused and determined to finish all tasks for the day. <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"
              target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a>
            improved my ability to
            focus and function, and I made absolutely no
            change to my diet, exercise or work schedule. My results came from only
            taking <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Week Three</h3>
        <div class="week">
          <p>The effects of <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a> are
            still with me, and I was pleased at how
            many items on my to-do list were crossed off. Previously, I had problems
            starting and completing tasks. <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X
              Focus</a> has me laser-focused on the job
            at hand, and I am suddenly able to get things done before I move on. I
            noticed throughout the week I was hardly ever stressed, and I was able
            to control my emotions without losing focus. I expected to run out of
            steam around the third week due to my body getting used to the
            ingredients. But my energy levels haven’t dipped at all. They remain
            steady throughout the day.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Week Four</h3>
        <div class="week">
          <p>I was given the nickname “Superman” at the office, as I’ve become the
            most productive member of the staff. I give all the credit to <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"
              target="_blank">Retro X
              Focus</a>.
            The drug worked as well this week as it had in previous weeks. My mind
            is crystal clear and I’m able to recall stored memories with near
            perfect accuracy. It’s unbelievable how much has changed in just 4 short
            weeks. It’s not like I became a genius overnight after taking <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"
              target="_blank">Retro X
              Focus</a>,
            but it’s definitely improved my memory and the speed at which I process
            new information.</p>
          <p>In conclusion: Over the past 4 weeks, I found myself bouncing out of
            bed, sometimes even before my alarm went off because I couldn’t wait to
            take <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a>. Things that used
            to annoy me were no longer an issue. I
            hardly got stressed and when I did, I was able to control my emotions
            and get back into peak performance mode. One thing I didn’t expect was
            the euphoric feeling I got while doing work on <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"
              target="_blank">Retro X Focus</a>.
            As a result, I’ve enjoyed my work so much more and my mood has greatly
            improved. In fact, my co-workers keep making fun of me for walking
            around with a permanent grin on my face.</p>
          <p>I’ve tried modafinil and countless other smart drugs, but this is by
            far the closest thing to feeling like you are the guy from Limitless.
            Don’t just take my word for it though; this is something you need to
            experience for yourself. For your convenience, I’ve provided a link
            below for a free trial bottle of <a href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click" target="_blank">Retro X
