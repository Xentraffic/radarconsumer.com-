          </h2>

          <h3>A New Engine-Tuning Chip Called <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click">Effuel</a>,
            Helped Derek Smith, Save on Gasoline While Reducing His Carbon Footprint</h3>
          <div class="buttonappear">
          </div>
          <p>“I had $46,000 in student loans to pay off. It sounds a lot but it was less than many of my friends. I was
            lucky that my parents helped me out a little.”</p>
          <p>Not only did Derek’s parents give him financial aid during school, they even let him come home after
            graduation to figure out his next step.</p>
          <p>“I stayed with my parents for the summer, applying for jobs in pharmaceuticals. <strong>I’m Type-A so I
              created a system where I could apply for 3-4 jobs a day.”</strong></p>
          <p>Most of the jobs were based in Dayton, Ohio, where Derek’s parents lived.</p>
          <p>“I was willing to go wherever there was work, I just wasn’t sure how I would get there.”</p>
          <p>Derek didn’t have a car. And his parents weren’t rich… so he could only use their minivan so much before he
            started feeling that he was a burden.</p>
          <p>Luckily, the hours of resume writing and interviews paid off at the end of July—Derek got a job offer.</p>
          <p>“I was going to be a regional sales rep for a BioTech company based in Columbus, Ohio. It was exactly the
            type of job I wanted—good salary, benefits, insurance, 401K plan, stock options. I wasn’t going to turn it
            down. <strong>But I didn’t know how I was going to get to work and back every day.”</strong></p>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"><img src="effuel2.jpg" width="730" height="414"></a>
          <h3 class="sub-title">Dayton to Columbus is About an Hour and Fifteen. So That Would be at Least Two and a
            Half Hours of Driving</h3>
          <p>On top of his commute, as a regional sales rep, Derek would be covering parts of Indiana, Kentucky, and
            West Virginia too.</p>
          <p>“I spoke to my Dad, he suggested I buy a sensible car—a Toyota Corolla. I knew that I would be driving a
            lot so the mpg rate (miles per gallon) was a big priority for me. I bought a used model, and my Dad came
            with me to the dealership to negotiate—so I got a pretty good deal.”</p>
          <p>Derek got the keys on Friday and started his new job on Monday.</p>
          <p>“They threw me straight in. That first week, I was in a different town every day trying to get PO’s
            <strong>(Purchase Orders).”</strong></p>
          <p>But Derek was enjoying the experience—earning good commission checks and impressing his boss.</p>
          <p><strong>And after being stuck at home in the suburbs for 3 months, being on the road and having his own car
              felt liberating…</strong></p>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"><img src="effuel3.jpg" width="730" height="414"></a>
          <h3 class="sub-title">That is Until Derek Calculated His Expenses at the End of the Month</h3>
          <p>“I drove almost 4,000 miles that first month. My fuel bill was topping $450. Even with the commissions, I
            didn’t think I could keep up the car payments and pay off my student loans.</p>
          <p><strong>I started to think that maybe my dream job wasn’t viable—all because of fuel prices.”</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Over the next month, Derek tried everything to improve his fuel economy:</strong> driving under the
            speed limit, checking his tire pressure every day, using his breaks less, and never turning on the air
            conditioning.</p>
          <p>“I might have saved a couple of bucks on fuel doing all this. But it was miserable. I had to drive around
            to find a gas station every day to check my tires. I was driving so far under the speed limit that I was
            struggling to make appointments on time—my boss wasn’t impressed. I got so obsessive about not using my
            breaks that I almost rear-ended someone on the freeway. And driving with no air conditioning in the middle
            of an Ohio summer was hell.”</p>
          <p>At one point, Derek considered quitting his job and working as a minimum-wage barista at a coffee shop in
            downtown Dayton.</p>
          <p><strong>“At least then I’d be able to take the bus.”</strong></p>
          <p>The answer to Derek’s problems came one day when he got a ride to a trade show with one of the other sales
            reps, named Mitch.</p>
          <p>“I was complaining to Mitch about all the driving I was doing and my sky-high fuel bill.”</p>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"><img src="effuel4.jpg" width="730" height="414"></a>
          <h3 class="sub-title">Mitch Had Been in the Game a Long Time, and He <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click">Had the
              Answer</a> to Derek’s Prayers, Right There Under the
            Steering Wheel</h3>
          <p>From just under, and to the left of the steering column, Mitch pulled out this wire with a green chip
            attached to it.</p>
          <p><strong>‘This little thing cuts down my fuel bill by 15%~35% per week’, Mitch said.</strong></p>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click">It’s called Effuel.</a> And it's a chip that
            remaps the car’s computer to make everything run more efficiently.</p>
          <p>And the best part is, once you install it, it’s totally ‘hands-off’. <strong>I can just drive like I
              normally do, knowing that this little thing is working hard to cut down my gasoline costs.</strong></p>
          <p>Mitch stepped hard on the gas and turned up the air-conditioning till it was like a fridge in there.</p>
          <p><strong>"I thought to myself, if a guy with lead foot who loves to leave the AC on all the time can save
              fuel, maybe I should look into this.”</strong></p>
          <p>As soon as he could, Derek snuck off the company table at the trade show and found a quiet corner of the
            arena. He took out his phone and <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click">visited
              their website.</a></p>
          <p>“At first I wasn’t sure. I studied Chemistry, not Engineering. Would I be able to install this thing?</p>
          <p>But the more I read about the product, the more I realized how easy it was to fit. I could do it myself in
            less than five minutes. And I saw the product comes with an instructional manual.</p>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click">And at just $39.98,</a> I thought: ‘If this
            cuts down my fuel costs and helps me do my job better, I’ll make thousands of dollars back. So I ordered it
            right there, and asked my parents to look out for my delivery.”</p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">But Before He Fitted the Effuel, Derek Did Something Unusual...</h3>
          <p><strong>It's easy to connect</strong>, <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click">simply plug into the outlet closest to
              your breaker box.</a>
            That is all you need to do, once plugged in the green LED indicates it is powered on and working.</p>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"><img src="effuel5.jpg" width="730" height="414"></a>
          <p><strong>“I wanted to do a test. So I drove for one week without the Effuel. I went my normal routes and
              didn’t change my driving at all.</strong></p>
          <p>A week later, I plugged the Effuel to my ODB2 socket (it was easy to find using the diagrams). And drove to
            work for another week.”</p>
          <p>Derek’s journey time was about 1 hour 22 minutes each way. His fuel consumption for the first week was 29
            mpg and for the 2nd week 38 mpg— <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click">a savings of
              25% &gt;&gt;</a></p>
          <p>“I couldn’t believe it. At that rate, I could travel to work for 4 weeks on 3 weeks' fuel money.”</p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">Fast-Forward 12 Months and Derek is Still Working at the Same Company</h3>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click"><img src="effuel6.jpg" width="730" height="414"></a>
          <p><strong>But he’s had two promotions and now has 50 outside sales reps working under him.</strong> He’s had
            two pay rises and he’s not on the road as much as he was when he first started.</p>
          <p>“Once I fitted the <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click">Effuel</a>, it gave me
            hope that I could control my fuel costs. That made me feel better about the job and about paying off my
            debts.”</p>
          <p>The low overheads from living with his parents, the commissions, and higher salary, along with the savings
            on his fuel bills, have allowed Derek to pay off his student loans.</p>
          <p><strong>And to celebrate, he bought himself a new car…</strong></p>
          <p>A Honda Accord.</p>
          <p><strong>“I gave my Toyota Corolla to my parents, to thank them for all their support. I left the Effuel in
              the car for them so they could enjoy lower fuel consumption too.”</strong></p>
          <p>Of course, <a target="_blank" href="https://intedure-virsoles.com/click">he bought a new Effuel for his
              new car &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>
          <p>“It works on all modern cars. I’ll remove the Effuel when I sell it—the engine just goes back to the
            factory settings.</p>
          <p>And better fuel efficiency means less wear-and-tear on the engine. I'm hoping to get about 50% of what I
            paid for the Corolla when I sell it.”</p>
